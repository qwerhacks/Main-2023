			<h1 class="capitalize">long blurb about this year's format</h1>
			<p>This year QWER Hacks is focused on another format of hackathon: doing more community engaged development and intentional development. We are seeking projects that exist at this intersection: unaddressed issues x importance to society. We want to see hacks of use and passion. We’ll have experts on various topics at the event to talk to but if you have an issue your passionate about and know a lot about, hack away!</p>
